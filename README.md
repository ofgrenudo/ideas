# Ideas
A repository to keep all of my ideas in.

- SERVEme: A simple web server (preferrably written in rust) that builds out to an executable that can be shipped on a thumbdrive. Inspired by [this linus tech tips video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EtgwIajVqs)
- WLANMONrs: A rust port of WLANMON that exists as executable I can package and ship to different devices. This would be a really good idea to do either in C or Rust.
- A command line adventure text adventure tool kit. You know all the basic tools available in a text adventure right? look, inspect, pickup, move, open, carry, read, etc. Integrate those into a toolkit package that alows you interact within the terminal as if you were in a command line adventure.
